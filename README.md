Hold The Angle is a web application used to track your own Valorant match stats for the past 10 games, emphasizing simplicity and visibility. A player is required to log in via RSO to be able to use the application. 

Some of the information the player would be able to view would be: 
- their own player stats, 
- significant match events round by round (plants, kills, best personal round)
- a graph depicting their progress by week (average kills, wins, etc. per week)
